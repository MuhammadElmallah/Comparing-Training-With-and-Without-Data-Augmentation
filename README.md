Comparing Training With and Without Data Augmentation

In the project I will use the Flowers-17 dataset, a very small dataset that only contains 1360 image with 17 classes (80 images per class)

AS Known, when applying deep learning to computer vision tasks it is optimal to have 1,000-5,000 examples per class. This means we have a very big problem of data shortage that we are trying to solve using data augmentation.

We will do to experiments:

1. Train MiniVGGNet on Flowers-17 without data augmentation.

2. Train MiniVGGNet on Flowers-17 with data augmentation.

The conclusion of this project is that applying data augmentation dramatically reduces overfitting and allows MiniVGGNet to obtain substantially higher classification accuracy.
